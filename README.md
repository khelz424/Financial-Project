VISUAL 1: Summary Report

The visuals provided showcase a summary of the cost of goods sold, gross sales, and profit for each country overall and based off the different products.

VISUAL 1.1: Sum Of COGS By Country

I chose a donut chart whcih provides a summary of the sum of cost of goods sold per country.

VISUAL 1.2: Sum Of Gross Sales, and Sum Of Profit By Country

I chose a clustered column chart as the visual which provides information about the comparison between the gross sales and profit per country.

SLICER 1: Year,Quarter,Month

I included a slicer where a user will be able to filter the visuals based off the Year,Quarter, and month.

SLICER 2: Product

I included a second slicer to enable a user to filter the visuals based off the product they are interested in.

Overall, this visual will allow users to understand the overall performance of the sales and costs that each country achieved during 2013 and 2014.


VISUAL 2: Segment Analysis

I included a pie chart to provide information about the sales per country based off the different segments.
